While doing this lab I encountered an error. After accessing the Cloudfront url, 
it timed out and led to "504 Gateway Timeout"

Troubleshooting the 504 Gateway Timeout:
A 504 Gateway Timeout means CloudFront successfully received the request from the viewer, 
but it failed to get a response from your origin (the S3 static website endpoint) within the default time limit.

The most common reason for this when using an S3 Static Website Endpoint as the origin is an "Origin Protocol Policy mismatch".

The Issue: 
The S3 Static Website Endpoint only supports HTTP (port 80), not HTTPS. 
If we set the Origin Protocol Policy in our CloudFront distribution to HTTPS Only, 
CloudFront will attempt to connect to S3 over HTTPS and will time out, resulting in a 504 error.

The Fix:

1. Go to the CloudFront distribution in the AWS console.
2. Select the Origins tab and edit the S3 origin.
3. Change the Origin Protocol Policy to HTTP Only.

Why this worked: 
1. CloudFront handles the HTTPS connection with the user/viewer at the Edge Location, 
but it talks to the S3 static website origin over plain HTTP.
2. CloudFront must communicate using HTTP because that S3 endpoint only supports HTTP.
2. Because the S3 static website endpoint is HTTP-only, AWS recommends and implements
the security using CloudFront as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in front of S3.

One more learning for Route 53:
Alias toggle: âœ… Only used for A or AAAA records pointing to AWS resources like CloudFront or ELB. You do NOT enable alias for ACM DNS validation.(You create a CNAME record for this.)
